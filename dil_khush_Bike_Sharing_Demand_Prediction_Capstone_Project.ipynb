        "Currently many urban cities have introduced rental bikes to improve mobility comfort (e.g. Rapido and Uber Moto in India). It is critical to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the appropriate time, as this reduces waiting time. Eventually, providing a steady supply of rental bikes to the city becomes a major concern. The critical part is predicting the number of bikes needed at each hour to ensure a steady supply of rental bikes.\n",

        "We performed exploratory data analysis on the provided dataset and discovered numerous findings that will be beneficial to rental bike companies. There are several factors driving the demand for rental bikes. We've selected the most useful features.\n",
        "\n",
        "We tested several machine learning models to correctly predict bike demand, which will save the company's resources and generate more and more profits.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to design different Machine Learning models and come up with the model which gives the best prediction of the rented bike count required to be supplied at each hour. Before designing any ML model, we require to clean the data and draw significant insights from the data. To begin with, we view the dataset including its description, various columns, number of null values, different categorical variables, unique value count, the shape of the dataset and different statistical parameters. We begin by removing the null values if any. Then we plot the distributions of each variable to see how the data is distributed. We get an idea about the skewness of the data. Ideally, we want our data to have a normal distribution. If there is skewness in the data we go for feature transformation. Visualizing different kinds of transformation on the skewed variables helps you to determine the best transformation for your features. We can check the numerical value of skewness of the variables using the .skew() method. We also plot a box plot of the features to check the outliers in the data. Outliers play a significant role in data analysis as they affect the statistical parameters. Then we plot the correlation heatmap to check for collinear features. Since collinearity is not desired in the data, we linearly combine the collinear features or drop them. In our project, Year and Dew point temperatures have the highest multi-correlation hence theyâ€™re dropped. Moving ahead, we analyze the categorical variables and perform one hot encoding for conversion. The original categorical columns are dropped and we get our final clean dataset. A feature importance graph is plotted to show which features contribute the most to our model. Then we perform the splitting of the data into train-test sets and perform feature scaling. Then we apply LR, Decision Tree, Random forest regression, XG Boost regression, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost models to get the best model for our business problem. We calculate the evaluation metrics R2 score, adjusted R2 and RMSE for each model. Then a model comparison chart is plotted to compare the metrics.XGBoost with Hypertunning gives the best results of all the models for the given business problem with R2 score=0.927 and adjusted R2 of 0.9267. Also, it has the lowest RMSE of all the models which equals 9.5 on training data and 174.12 on test data."
